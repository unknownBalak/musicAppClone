# mucicApp Clone written in HTML and CSS

I tried to build a clone of imaginary Music Company. It is written in only CSS and HTML. I would like to thanks @Web Dev Simplified for resources and @Dev Ed for design. It was quite fun to build this application without using
any frame and library.
See the landing page of the application. It is quite beautiful.
